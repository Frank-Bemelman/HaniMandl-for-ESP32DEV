# HaniMandl for ESP32DEV board

First, thanks to all contributors for their work and inspiration. I decided to make my own fork as I intend to make a number of changes. 

Changes are mostly cosmetic. Needs a 320x240 tft display, ST7789 model. Uses antialiased fonts for nicer display
Use of graphic image as startup screen

If you want to use ILI9341 display, see platformio.ini for build flags, and change ST7789_DRIVER=1 to ILI9341_DRIVER=1 

Is tailored to platformio which I prefer over the Arduino IDE

Work in progress, provided as is. It is not finished yet.

Cheers, 
Frank
