# HaniMandl for ESP32DEV board

First, thanks to all contributors for their work and inspiration. I decided to make my own fork as I intend to make a number of changes. 

Changes are mostly cosmetic. Needs a 320x240 tft display, ST7789 model. Uses antialiased fonts for nicer display
Use of graphic image as startup screen

Is tailored to platformio which I prefer over the Arduino IDE

Work in progress, provided as is.

Cheers, 
Frank
